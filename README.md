# SplitRoster

One of my relatives is a teacher. One day she was talking to me about her day and she explained how she had to create a split roster for her classroom. When she is absent, her students are divided up into other classrooms depending on their capacity for each period. She emphasized to me that she had to go one by one and place each student in each class period. I realized I could help solve her problem using Python and this is the current version. This program takes input from a spreadsheet of Student Names, Class Periods, and Classroom Availability to create a Split Roster.

Future Improvements:
I am still researching how to place each name on a new line in a single cell in the Split Roster. Currently, students are separated by a semicolon.
I would like to create a User Interface for teachers to use the application.
